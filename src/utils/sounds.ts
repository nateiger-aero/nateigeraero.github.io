/**
 * Sound effects, played through the Web Audio API.
 *
 * The obvious implementation — `new Audio(src).play()` per sound — is what this
 * replaces, and it behaves badly on iOS:
 *
 *  - **Late.** Each call built a fresh element, which then had to fetch and
 *    decode the file before it made a sound. These are uncompressed .wav files,
 *    so on a phone the delay is audible against the click that caused it.
 *  - **Silent.** Safari only lets audio start from inside a user gesture, and
 *    an element created after a timeout has no gesture behind it. The startup
 *    sound is fired 500ms after the login click and is exactly that case.
 *  - **Unbounded.** A new element per play, none of them released.
 *
 * Decoding each clip once and firing a buffer source per play fixes all three:
 * playback becomes a scheduling call with no I/O, and one unlock during the
 * first gesture covers every sound afterwards.
